## Assignment 12
Part A: Using our custom library to train a ResNet-18 on Tiny Imagenet-200 dataset.

Part B: Downloding about 100 images that contain hardhat, vest, bask and masks. Our task was to annotate these and find the ideal number of anchor boxes that would be required to train a YOLO object detection model on this dataset.
